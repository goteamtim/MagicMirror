MagicMirror

## Introduction

This is the magic behind the magic mirror projects.  The code runs a node server to serve the mirror.

## Setup

```npm install```

```bower install```

## Configuration

Once installed, navigate to localhost:3000/setup to setup your mirror.  You need to get various API keys for some features to work.

## TODO

* Add Uber wait time estimates
* Top stories- maybe add option to send to phone or pc via email or text
* Calendar integration
