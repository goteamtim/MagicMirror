<p>This project was designed with the idea that someone without a lot of technical experience could download this code, drop it on a raspberry pi, hook up a monitor, and have a magic mirror.  A tutorial on how to set this up is coming soon.  Changes to make the mirror custom are handled by a setup page so you don't have to dive into too much code.  </p>

<a id="customize" class="anchor" href="#customize" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Customize</h3>

<p>The idea is to be able to add elements and remove them as you see fit.  If you have a suggestion please feel free to fork but let me know as well!  I would love to see what you came up with.  </p>

<p>Right now I (<a href="https://github.com/goteamtim" class="user-mention">@goteamtim</a>) am the only contributor but would love some help.  Feel free to reach out if you want to help out.  I happily welcome someone else to learn with me.</p>

<p>More documentation is on it's way.  My hope is to make the code setup as easy as possible.</p>
